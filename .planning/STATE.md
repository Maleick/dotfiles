## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Keep repo as plain dotfiles + installer, not app rewrite.
- [Init]: Preserve aliasr and Warp compatibility as non-negotiable behaviors.
- [Init]: Skip separate domain research; use codebase map as primary context.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Cross-platform command differences in shell helpers need explicit validation.
- Documentation drift risk between README/AGENTS/CHANGELOG and actual config behavior.
