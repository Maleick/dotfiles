## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Reset]: Reinitialized project in auto mode from `idea.md`.
- [Scope]: Reliability sprint stays terminal-first and source-of-truth driven.
- [Process]: Research enabled and phases derived from requirement coverage.
- [Installer]: Treat already-correct symlinks as explicit no-op states.
- [Verification]: Baseline checks are command-driven and recorded in phase artifacts.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- None in Phase 1 baseline execution.
