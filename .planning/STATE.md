## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Reset]: Reinitialized project in auto mode from `idea.md`.
- [Scope]: Reliability sprint stays terminal-first and source-of-truth driven.
- [Process]: Research enabled and phases derived from requirement coverage.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Must keep docs synchronized after behavior changes to prevent operator drift.
