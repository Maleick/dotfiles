# v1.1 Compatibility Matrix

## Scope

This matrix captures baseline compatibility outcomes for install, shell, tmux, vim, and docs parity checks in this repository.

Phase boundary:
- Documentation and coverage guidance only.
- No runtime feature expansion.

## Status Semantics

- `PASS`: Observed command execution succeeded for the stated environment and scope.
- `FAIL`: Observed command execution failed for the stated environment and scope.
- `SKIP`: Check was not executed in that environment context; caveat explains why.

## Command Set Reference

Primary command references used to populate this matrix:
- `./scripts/verify-suite.sh`
- `.planning/phases/01-installation-baseline/01-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`
- `.planning/phases/05-validation-wrapper-baseline/05-VERIFICATION.md`

## Matrix

| Environment Profile | Check Scope | Status | Caveat | Command Set Reference | Last Validated |
|---------------------|-------------|--------|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| macOS (Darwin arm64, current host) | install/shell/tmux/vim/docs parity | PASS | host-specific: observed wrapper JSON run from current host | ./scripts/verify-suite.sh --json | 2026-02-25 |
| macOS (Darwin arm64, current host) | optional dependency probes (`asciinema`, `fzf`) | SKIP | optional-dependency: optional tool coverage may be partial; inspect per-check JSON statuses | ./scripts/verify-suite.sh --json | 2026-02-25 |
| Linux (baseline target profile) | install/shell/tmux/vim/docs parity | SKIP | `not-observed`: Linux run not observed in this host session; execute wrapper/checklist on Linux before promoting to PASS/FAIL | `./scripts/verify-suite.sh` + `.planning/phases/01-installation-baseline/01-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` | 2026-02-25 |

## Caveat Tags

- `optional-dependency`: Optional tooling availability affects status details.
- `host-specific`: Outcome is tied to the observed host profile.
- `not-observed`: Environment has not been directly validated in this session.

## Freshness Policy

Refresh this matrix when any of the following occur:
- verification command changes
- runtime contract changes (`install.sh`, `zsh/.zshrc`, `tmux/.tmux.conf`, `vim/.vimrc`)
- documentation contract changes (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`)
- milestone closeout validation

## Evidence Notes

- Current host observation: `Darwin arm64`, wrapper run result `SUMMARY | PASS=8 FAIL=0 SKIP=1` on 2026-02-25.
- Required-check behavior and optional fail-soft contract are recorded in `.planning/phases/05-validation-wrapper-baseline/05-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Baseline command intent for cross-environment runs is anchored in `.planning/phases/01-installation-baseline/01-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.
