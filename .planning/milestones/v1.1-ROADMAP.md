# Milestone v1.1: automation

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-25
**Phases:** 5-6
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

This milestone delivered reliability automation on top of the shipped v1.0 runtime baseline. Work focused on a one-command verification wrapper and a compatibility matrix artifact grounded in observed command evidence, while preserving terminal-first workflow contracts.

## Phases

### Phase 5: Validation Wrapper Baseline
**Goal**: Operators can run one command from repo root to verify core runtime contracts quickly and reliably.
**Depends on**: v1.0 shipped baseline
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Implement wrapper orchestration and check catalog contracts.
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Harden output semantics, fail-soft handling, and wrapper documentation.

**Details:**
- Canonical command implemented at `./scripts/verify-suite.sh`.
- Required checks for install/shell/tmux/vim/docs parity run in deterministic order.
- Output and exit contracts locked (`PASS`/`FAIL`/`SKIP`, non-zero on required failure).
- Optional dependencies (`asciinema`, `fzf`) remain fail-soft with actionable guidance.

### Phase 6: Compatibility Matrix and Coverage
**Goal**: Compatibility guidance is grounded in validated check outcomes and remains easy for operators to follow.
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Create compatibility matrix artifact from validated checks.
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Integrate matrix guidance into docs and verification flow.

**Details:**
- Canonical artifact created at `.planning/compatibility/v1.1-matrix.md`.
- Matrix rows enforce schema: environment profile, check scope, status, caveat, command reference, last-validated date.
- Documentation linkage added in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` for operator/maintainer usage.

## Milestone Summary

**Stats:**
- Phases: 2
- Plans: 4
- Tasks: 8
- Git range: `v1.0..HEAD`
- Change volume: 28 files changed, 1846 insertions(+), 314 deletions(-)
- Timeline: 2026-02-25 to 2026-02-25

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. Added tracked verification entrypoint `scripts/verify-suite.sh` with repo-root, non-interactive contract.
2. Standardized deterministic wrapper status semantics and fail-soft optional dependency behavior.
3. Published canonical compatibility matrix `.planning/compatibility/v1.1-matrix.md` with evidence-backed baseline rows.
4. Integrated matrix interpretation and maintenance policy into `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
5. Verified `AUTO-01`/`AUTO-02`/`AUTO-03` and `COMP-01`/`COMP-02` as complete.

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep verification read-only and terminal-first; no runtime auto-rewrite behavior.
- Use explicit `PASS`/`SKIP`/`FAIL` matrix semantics and observed-evidence-only policy.
- Keep advanced automation (`AUTO-04`, `AUTO-05`, `COMP-03`) deferred beyond this milestone.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Lack of single-command reliability validation flow.
- Missing compatibility artifact for baseline macOS/Linux expectations.
- Drift risk between verification behavior and maintainer/operator documentation.

**Issues Deferred:**
- `AUTO-04` quick-mode execution.
- `AUTO-05` machine-readable output mode.
- `COMP-03` generated matrix rows from repeatable run history.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Milestone archived without formal `v1.1` audit artifact (`.planning/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`) by explicit choice; accepted process debt.
