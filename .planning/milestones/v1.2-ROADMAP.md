# Milestone v1.2: automation expansion

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-25
**Phases:** 7-8
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

This milestone expanded verification and compatibility automation while preserving the existing terminal-first runtime contracts. It shipped quick and machine-readable wrapper modes, then added deterministic compatibility matrix evidence automation with strict schema and provenance guardrails.

## Phases

### Phase 7: Verification Wrapper Modes and Output Contracts
**Goal**: `./scripts/verify-suite.sh` supports quick mode and machine-readable output while preserving existing deterministic default behavior.
**Depends on**: Phase 5 baseline wrapper contract
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Implement quick-mode invocation and locked subset behavior.
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Implement JSON/combined mode behavior and documentation alignment.

**Details:**
- Added `--quick` mode with locked minimum required-check subset and explicit quick-mode `SKIP` visibility for full-only required checks.
- Added deterministic `--json` output contract and combined `--quick --json` behavior.
- Preserved non-zero required-failure semantics across default, quick, json, and combined modes.
- Synced operator and maintainer mode contracts in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

### Phase 8: Compatibility Matrix Evidence Automation
**Goal**: Compatibility matrix rows can be generated/updated from observed verification evidence without inferred status claims.
**Depends on**: Phase 7 JSON evidence output contract
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Build deterministic matrix evidence-ingestion and row update engine.
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Document automation workflow and capture targeted verification evidence.

**Details:**
- Added `scripts/update-compat-matrix.sh` and `scripts/update_compat_matrix.py` for deterministic matrix row updates.
- Enforced key-based update semantics (`Environment Profile` + `Check Scope`) with in-place update or deterministic insert.
- Enforced schema/status/provenance guardrails (`PASS`/`SKIP`/`FAIL`, required row fields, fail-fast malformed evidence/schema rejection).
- Added phase verification artifact proving deterministic update, new-row insertion, and rejection-path behavior.

## Milestone Summary

**Stats:**
- Phases: 2
- Plans: 4
- Tasks: 8
- Git range: `v1.1..HEAD`
- Change volume: 31 files changed, 2250 insertions(+), 347 deletions(-)
- Timeline: 2026-02-25 to 2026-02-25

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. Added wrapper quick mode with explicit subset semantics while preserving default behavior.
2. Added deterministic machine-readable wrapper output and combined-mode support.
3. Implemented deterministic matrix row automation from observed wrapper JSON evidence.
4. Added strict schema/provenance guardrails and fail-fast rejection for malformed evidence/schema.
5. Synced README/AGENTS with automation contracts and captured goal-backward verification for `COMP-03`.

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep no-flag wrapper behavior backward compatible while extending modes.
- Keep matrix claims evidence-only and guardrailed by strict schema/status vocabulary.
- Keep Phase 8 scope focused on local automation and documentation, not CI/pipeline expansion.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Missing quick-check path for faster local verification loops.
- Missing machine-readable wrapper output for deterministic parsing.
- Manual, non-deterministic compatibility matrix row maintenance.

**Issues Deferred:**
- `AUTO-06` output schema versioning.
- CI-provider integration and matrix publication pipelines.
- Broader environment permutation expansion (`COMP-04+`).

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Milestone archived without formal `.planning/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`; accepted process debt for this closeout run.
