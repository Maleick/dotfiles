# Requirements: Red Team Dotfiles Reliability Sprint

**Defined:** 2026-02-25
**Core Value:** An operator can bootstrap and trust a stable red-team shell environment in minutes, without regressions in critical workflows.

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for the v1.2 milestone. Each maps to exactly one roadmap phase.

### Wrapper Modes and Contracts

- [x] **AUTO-04**: Operator can run a quick verification mode from repo root that completes faster while preserving a locked minimum required-check signal.
- [x] **AUTO-05**: Operator can run a machine-readable output mode that reports per-check `PASS`/`FAIL`/`SKIP` statuses and deterministic summary counts without changing default human-readable output behavior.

### Compatibility Evidence Automation

- [x] **COMP-03**: Maintainer can generate/update compatibility matrix rows from observed verification run evidence with canonical schema fields and validation date provenance.

## Requirement Outcomes

- `AUTO-04`: **Validated** — quick-mode path shipped with explicit subset semantics and preserved required-failure behavior.
- `AUTO-05`: **Validated** — deterministic JSON output and combined `--quick --json` behavior shipped with backward-compatible default mode.
- `COMP-03`: **Validated** — deterministic matrix automation shipped with key-based update/insert and fail-fast schema/evidence guards.

## Deferred Beyond v1.2

### Extended Automation

- `AUTO-06`: Add output schema versioning and compatibility guarantees for downstream parsers.
- `COMP-04`: Expand compatibility matrix coverage across broader distro/terminal profile permutations.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| CI-provider-specific integration scaffolding | Local operator workflow remains primary scope |
| Auto-install missing dependencies during verify run | Violates read-only verification posture |
| Auto-rewrite runtime config files from verification command | High side-effect risk and trust degradation |
| Net-new shell/tmux/vim feature families | Milestone is automation and evidence hygiene only |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AUTO-04 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| AUTO-05 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| COMP-03 | Phase 8 | Complete |
